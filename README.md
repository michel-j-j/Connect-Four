## Introduction

Connect Four is a two-player game in which the players take turns dropping colored discs into a grid. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs of your color.

This repository provides a Java implementation of the Connect Four game. The project consists of both server and client components. The server manages the game state and coordinates the actions of the players, while the client allows players to connect and play the game.

## Features

- Server-client architecture for multiplayer gameplay
- Interactive console-based user interface
- Fully functional Connect Four gameplay
- Clear and concise codebase for easy understanding and extension
